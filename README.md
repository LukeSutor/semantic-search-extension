# Chrome Semantic Search Extension

This extension semantically searches information on webpages based on user queries. Semantically searching is useful because you can answer questions from webpages without phrasing your question exactly how it's worded on the website.  
It was created using a react-chrome extension boilerplate found [here](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite).
